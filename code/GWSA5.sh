# This script is a control script for genome-wide analysis of DMS-MaPseq
# data in different conditions, starting with BAM files (i.e. mapped reads)
# as input.

# This is step 5 of 8, where sites are retained only if they exist (i.e.
# have already passed the coverage threshold condition) in ALL samples.
# Note that the earlier normalization step has already partly imposed this
# condition, as retained (i.e. normalized) sites must have passed the
# threshold criterion in each control/DMS-treated sample pair.
